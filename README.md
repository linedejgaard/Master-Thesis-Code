# Formal Specifications of a Kernel Memory Manager in the Verified Software Toolchain



This project formally specifies the behavior of the kernel memory management functions `kalloc` and `kfree` from the xv6 operating system using the Verified Software Toolchain (VST) within the Rocq environment. It provides two layers of specifications: an abstract layer for simplified C implementations, and a type-enriched specification layer for verifying client functions that use the memory manager.

Moreover, simplified implementations of `kalloc` and `kfree` are verified against the abstract specification, and many client functions calling `kalloc` and `kfree` are verified using the type-based specifications to examine their applicability.

## Project structure

All code, specifications, and proofs were developed using **VST** within the **Rocq interactive proof environment**. The project contains approximately **2,525 lines of code**, distributed as follows:

## How to compile

- Compile C code to Rocq representation: `clightgen -normalize <c-file>.c`

- In this directory, use `make clean` to clean the project, and `make` to compile the Rocq files.

- Edit the `_CoqProject` file to compile fewer files. Note that some files depend on each other.
